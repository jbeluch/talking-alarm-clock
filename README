This is a small script, that when coupled with festival and cron, can act as a talking alarm clock.

The main script is alarm.py.  It checks in the same folder for a .config file, or you can specify a different config filename as an argument on the command line when calling the script.  The .config file contains login information and paths to template files for building output.

The script prints the talking text to stdout, which can then be piped into festival.  See crontab_entry for example entries to use this as a talking alarm clock.
